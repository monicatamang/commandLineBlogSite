She squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement, trying to decipher exactly what she had spied. The more she peered, however, the more she thought it might be a figment of her imagination. Nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree. Then in the corner of her eye, she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again. Waiting and watching. It was all she had done for the past weeks. When you’re locked in a room with nothing but food and drink, that’s about all you can do anyway. She watched as birds flew past the window bolted shut. She couldn’t reach it if she wanted too, with that hole in the floor.

Both were curious, but only one was brave enough to want to explore. That was the problem. There was always one that let fer rule her life. She had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears. The way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person. Of course, she couldn\'t scientifically prove any of this, but that didn\'t matter to her. Before anything else, she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to. The red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox. It had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well. The other toys grumbled beneath. At one time each had held the spot of the red ball, but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box.',9),('jackieuweh','She asked the question even though she didn\'t really want to hear the answer. It was a no-win situation since she already knew. If he told the truth, she\'d get confirmation of her worst fears. If he lied, she\'d know that he wasn\'t who she thought he was which would be almost as bad. Yet she asked the question anyway and waited for his answer. She looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen. She tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry. It hit her all at once. She was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear, sadness, and pride all running through her at the same time. Was it enough? That was the question he kept asking himself. Was being satisfied enough? He looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal. He knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasn\'t going to be enough. The shoes had been there for as long as anyone could remember. In fact, it was difficult for anyone to come up with a date they had first appeared. It had seemed they\'d always been there and yet they seemed so out of place. Why nobody had removed them was a question that had been asked time and again, but while they all thought it, nobody had ever found the energy to actually do it. So, the shoes remained on the steps, out of place in one sense, but perfectly normal in another. He was aware there were numerous wonders of this world including the unexplained creations of humankind that showed the wonder of our ingenuity. There are huge heads on Easter Island. There are the Egyptian pyramids. There’s Stonehenge. But he now stood in front of a newly discovered monument that simply didn\'t make any sense and he wondered how he was ever going to be able to explain it.',10),('shaynetopp','What have you noticed today? I noticed that if you outline the eyes, nose, and mouth on your face with your finger, you make an \"I\" which makes perfect sense, but is something I never noticed before. What have you noticed today? There was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming. In his youth, he sought adventure and the unknown, but that had been years ago. He wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless. That curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone. He couldn\'t move. His head throbbed and spun. He couldn\'t decide if it was the flu or the drinking last night. It was probably a combination of both. There were little things that she simply could not stand. The sound of someone tapping their nails on the table. A person chewing with their mouth open. Another human imposing themselves into her space. She couldn\'t stand any of these things, but none of them compared to the number one thing she couldn\'t stand which topped all of them combined. According to the caption on the bronze marker placed by the Multnomah Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution on May 12, 1939, “College Hall (is) the oldest building in continuous use for Educational purposes west of the Rocky Mountains. Here were educated men and women who have won recognition throughout the world in all the learned professions.”',11),('shaynetopp','I\'m meant to be writing at this moment. What I mean is, I\'m meant to be writing something else at this moment. The document I\'m meant to be writing is, of course, open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention. Yet here I am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because it\'s easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful. I am grateful for the distraction. She didn\'t understand how changed worked. When she looked at today compared to yesterday, there was nothing that she could see that was different. Yet, when she looked at today compared to last year, she couldn\'t see how anything was ever the same. Sometimes it\'s simply better to ignore the haters. That\'s the lesson that Tom\'s dad had been trying to teach him, but Tom still couldn\'t let it go. He latched onto them and their hate and couldn\'t let it go, but he also realized that this wasn\'t healthy. That\'s when he came up with his devious plan. Her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair. They were thick and almost horizontal, emphasizing the depth of her eyes. She was rather handsome than beautiful. Her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features. Her manner was engaging. It was their first date and she had been looking forward to it the entire week. She had her eyes on him for months, and it had taken a convoluted scheme with several friends to make it happen, but he\'d finally taken the hint and asked her out. After all the time and effort she\'d invested into it, she never thought that it would be anything but wonderful. It goes without saying that things didn\'t work out quite as she expected.',13);
